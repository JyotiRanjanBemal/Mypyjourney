  Placement Prediction System Using Machine Learning
The general Placement Prediction System considers only academic performances in order to predict whether a student can be placed or not. Judging the student based only on his academic performances would be unfair for the student, since a student could be having good aptitude, technical and communication skills but unfortunately might not be good in academic performances. It would wrong to judge a student based only on his academic performances, since Predicting the placement of a student needs a lot of parameters to be considered. But in order to get selected in campus interview, the student must be good in technical and aptitude 
skills. Of course academic performances are important but donâ€™t hold the highest importance in the outcome of student placement. This project is made focused on all those skills that an individual must possess to get placed.
